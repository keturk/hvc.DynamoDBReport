# hvc.DynamoDBReport.Model

The `hvc.DynamoDBReport.Model` module defines the data structures and models used throughout the `hvc.DynamoDBReport` suite. These models ensure a consistent representation of data as it flows through the various stages of report generation, parsing, and analysis.

## Features:

- **Consistent Data Structures**: Provides a unified way to represent data, ensuring consistency across modules.
- **Extensible Models**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new data fields or structures as needed.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that data is always of the expected type, reducing the chances of runtime errors.

## Getting Started:

To work with the models, familiarize yourself with the data structures defined in this module. They serve as the foundation for all data operations within the `hvc.DynamoDBReport` suite.
