# Open Source Attributions

For domain specific language parsing, **hvc.DynamoDBReport** uses **[Antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/)**. Antrl4 is an open source parser generator started by **[Professor Terence J. Parr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Parr)**

**hvc.DynamoDBReport** uses C# files generated by Antlr4. hvc.DynamoDBReport.Parser references to Antlr4.Runtime.Standard 4.9.3 nuget package.

For parts of code generation, **hvc.DynamoDBReport** uses **[StringTemplate4](https://www.stringtemplate.org/)** template engine which was also started by **Professor Parr**. 

SimpleTemplate4 is implicitly used via [hvc.Generator](https://github.com/keturk/hvc.Generator) nuget package which has it's own GitHub repository.



# Introduction
Simply, **hvc.DynamoDBReport** parses queries defined with a simple domain specific language (DSL) and generates Python script(s) which can query an [AWS DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/index.html) table using **Boto3** and **PrettyTable**.

As of now, **hvc.DynamoDBReport** generates a Python script that uses Boto3. But generated code does NOT support [PartiQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html) which also can be used to query AWS DynamoDB tables. 

Although, it doesn't support **PartiQL** for now, **hvc.DynamoDBReport** is not developed as an alternative to **PartiQL**. Future versions of **hvc.DynamoDBReport** may add **PartiQL** support if there is enough interest for it.

# Target Platforms
**hvc.DynamoDBReport** is developed with **.NET 6** as a cross-platform project. **.Net 6** supports **Microsoft Windows**, **Linux**, and **Mac** operating systems as is the x64 architecture and ARM of **Windows** and **Linux** are supported.
